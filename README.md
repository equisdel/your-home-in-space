# 🌙 Lunaria

> Design the future of human space habitation.  
> Created for **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 – "Your Home in Space"**

## 🧭 Overview

**Lunaria** places you in the role of the **Chief Designer of Lunatic Housing** —  
NASA’s lead architect for off-world living.

Your mission: design safe, efficient, and comfortable habitats for astronauts  
stationed on the **lunar south pole**, where days and nights each last 14 Earth days.

Every mission brings new parameters — crew size, duration, objectives —  
and your layout will determine their survival, comfort, and success.  
At the end of each mission, your design is **evaluated and scored**,  
based on NASA’s research on **EVA operations, life support systems, and spatial ergonomics**.

## 🌌 Concept Summary

Designing functional habitats for space exploration is one of humanity’s greatest challenges.  
**Lunaria** transforms this challenge into an interactive simulation that merges **engineering logic** and **human-centered design**.

Players:
- 🧱 **Design** modular lunar habitats based on mission constraints.  
- 👩‍🚀 **Experience** their designs in first-person, testing comfort and usability.  
- 🔬 **Learn** about real NASA research in EVA systems, life support, and habitat design.  

Each decision affects the outcome — efficiency, cost, comfort, and crew morale.
